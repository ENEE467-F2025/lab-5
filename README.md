# ENEE 467 Fall 2025: Robotics Project Laboratory
## Lab 5: Collision-Free Kinematic Planning in ROS 2

This repository contains a Docker container for Lab 5 (Collision-Free Kinematic Planning in ROS 2) as well as the necessary code templates for completing the exercises. Software for both parts is provided in this repo; the manuals will specify which packages to run for which labs.

## Overview

Motion planning is the robotics subfield concerned with computing a continuous, collision-free motion that takes a robot from a start configuration to a goal configuration. Unlike the forward and inverse kinematics problems that are only concerned with the robot's geometry and not its workspace, motion planning entails reasoning about the robot's motion relative to other artifacts in its environment, including objects to be grasped and workspace obstacles, ensuring that joint limits, dynamic constraints, and collision avoidance requirements are respected throughout the motion. As such, motion planning forms a critical component for robots operating in semi-controlled or unstructured humanâ€“machine environments. Thus, this lab is designed to equip you with the skills required to both effectively utilize de facto modern motion planning software and to develop independent and ROS 2 compliant motion planning programs of your own.

## Lab Software

To avoid software conflicts and increase portability, all lab software will be packaged as a Docker container. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Building the Container

First check to see if the image is prebuilt on the lab computer by running the following command
```
docker image ls
```
If you see the image named `lab-5-image` in the list then you can **skip** the build process.

To build the Docker container, ensure that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed and the Docker daemon running.
* Clone this repository and navigate to the `docker` folder
    ```
    cd ~/Labs
    git clone https://github.com/ENEE467-F2025/lab-5.git
    cd lab-5/docker
    ```
* Build the image with Docker compose
    ```
    userid=$(id -u) groupid=$(id -g) docker compose -f lab-5-compose.yml build
    ```

## Starting the Container

The lab computers contain a prebuilt image so you typically won't have to build the image.

- Recommended (one command): run the helper script from the repo root on the host
    ```bash
    ./lab5.run.sh
    ```
    This will:
    - Launch the container via Docker Compose in the background
    - Open VS Code attached to the running container at `/home/robot/ros2_ws`

- Manual (alternative):
    ```bash
    cd ~/Labs/lab-5/docker
    userid=$(id -u) groupid=$(id -g) docker compose -f lab-5-compose.yml up -d
    ```

Once inside the container (e.g., using `docker exec -it lab-5-container bash -i`), your prompt should look like
```
robot@<host>:~$
```

Edit the lab-5 Python (ROS 2) code within the `lab-5/src` and `lab-5/src/exercise` folders from a VS Code editor on the host machine. The repo directory `lab-5/src` is mounted to the docker container at `/home/robot/ros2_ws/src`, so changes are reflected inside the container.

To build the workspace inside the container:
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

## Attaching A Docker Container to VSCode
```bash
code --folder-uri vscode-remote://attached-container+$(printf "$(docker ps -q --filter name=lab-5-container)" | od -A n -t x1 | sed 's/ *//g' | tr -d '\n')/home/robot/ros2_ws
```
## Lab Instructions

Please follow the [lab manual](Lab_5_Collision_Free_Motion_Planning_I.pdf) closely. All instructions are contained inside the lab manual.
